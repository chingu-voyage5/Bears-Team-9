### The Buffer Clone

The overall objective of this project is to clone [Buffer](https://buffer.com/).  

The first part of the objective is to develop ability to post something to a single API (Yet to be determined which social media we will be selecting).

This will consistue as a MVP's objective:
1. Set up [MERN stack](https://github.com/Hashnode/mern-starter) to handle all aspects of the project
2. Create a backend to handle user's account information and API
3. Create a usable frontend for user to post to their selected social media.


## Masterminds behind this project:

### Miguel T Rivera 

I'm interested in learning Python for data science. I'm using the MERN stack currently for the advanced FCC projects.
I'm going to implement Marko for some of my projects instead of React.

Hi my name is Miguel T Rivera. I'm from Nor Cal (Northern California) and member of the freeCodeCamp Sacramento Meetup group.

*Coding Background*
I started with HTML in the late 90's. At a local community college, did a lot of C++, a little bit of Java and one semester of Python. Went to 4-year university to study Computer Science but I had a bad teacher, so I changed my major. In 2016, got back into programing through the freeCodeCamp program. I completed the front-end portion in Oct 2017. Currently, going through the full-stack application and data visualization certifications.

*Goals*
- Complete a team project
- Pair program
- Learn Python and dabble in data science
- Get more comfortable with React
- Get a developer job


### Luis Jimenez	
I was born and raised in Mexico City until the age of 13, when I moved to Texas, where I still currently live. I’m 19 years old, finished my third year in college (B.S. in Pure Mathematics and a Certificate in Numerical Analysis).
Coding: I started programming when I started college. I did a semester of Java and two semesters in C and parallel programming. I then started self-teaching web dev HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS and eventually did a lot of PHP. Recently I’ve built a couple of small websites for relatives using Laravel (PHP framework) and MySQL for backend and html, css and Vue for front end.
I’m comfortable with git, the Linux environment, ES6, webpack, SASS. This past semester I had an algorithms and software design class using Python, so I’d be okay with using that for the project.
